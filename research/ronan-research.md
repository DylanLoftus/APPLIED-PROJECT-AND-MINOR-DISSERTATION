## Virtual Reality in Education

[Wikipedia: Virtual Reality Applications -> Education and Training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_applications#Education_and_training)

* "VR is used to help learners develop skills without the real-world consequences of failing, especially useful in realms with life-or-death implications."

Results:
* "Gallbladder dissection was 29% faster for VR-trained residents."
* "Non-VR-trained residents were nine times more likely to transiently fail to make progress (P < .007, Mann-Whitney test) and five times more likely to injure the gallbladder or burn nontarget tissue (chi-square = 4.27, P < .04)."
* "Mean errors were six times less likely to occur in the VR-trained group (1.19 vs. 7.38 errors per case;P < .008, Mann-Whitney test)."

Concludes:
* "Virtual reality is an effective method to supplement lessons in anatomy for students studying health sciences and medicine. **Mobile based virtual reality is as effective as desktop based virtual reality, and requires a substantially lower cost for setup.** However, shorter lessons in the virtual environment are required, as mobile virtual reality lessons can cause more cybersickness and adverse effects than desktop based applications."

"A serious game or applied game is a game designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment."
