## Virtual Reality in Education

[Wikipedia: Virtual Reality Applications -> Education and Training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_applications#Education_and_training)

* "VR is used to help learners develop skills without the real-world consequences of failing, especially useful in realms with life-or-death implications."

[Paper: Virtual Reality Training Improves Operating Room Performance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1422600/)

Results:
* "Gallbladder dissection was 29% faster for VR-trained residents."
* "Non-VR-trained residents were nine times more likely to transiently fail to make progress (P < .007, Mann-Whitney test) and five times more likely to injure the gallbladder or burn nontarget tissue (chi-square = 4.27, P < .04)."
* "Mean errors were six times less likely to occur in the VR-trained group (1.19 vs. 7.38 errors per case;P < .008, Mann-Whitney test)."

[Paper: Virtualisation devices for student learning: Comparison between desktop-based (Oculus Rift) and mobile-based (Gear VR) virtual reality in medical and health science education](https://ajet.org.au/index.php/AJET/article/view/3840)

Concludes:
* "Virtual reality is an effective method to supplement lessons in anatomy for students studying health sciences and medicine. **Mobile based virtual reality is as effective as desktop based virtual reality, and requires a substantially lower cost for setup.** However, shorter lessons in the virtual environment are required, as mobile virtual reality lessons can cause more cybersickness and adverse effects than desktop based applications."

### Serious games

[Wikipedia: Serious game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game)

"A serious game or applied game is a game designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment."

"The idea shares aspects with simulation generally, including flight simulation and medical simulation, but explicitly emphasizes the added pedagogical value of fun and competition."

### Michael Sutton
Michael Sutton is a game-based learning author, educator, and innovator. He uses game-based learning to motivate engagement, innovation, creativity, retention, entrepreneurship, and performance improvements.

## Gamification
### What is Gamification?

[Bunchball: Gamification](https://www.bunchball.com/gamification)

Gamification is a process in which we look at something that already exists and that we wouldn’t consider to be a game for example scanning items at a till and make it into a game. Gamification is already present in many things for example the dashboard of the Ford Fusion hybrid. On the dashboard there are vine leaves present. If you waste fuel the leaves wither but if you conserve fuel they blossom.

### What is Gamification used for?

[Tophat](https://tophat.com/blog/gamification-education-class/)

Gamification is used to promote participation, engagement and learning through means of rewarding the participant for completing tasks in the workplace, school etc.

### What benefits does Gamification bring?

[Learnlight](https://insights.learnlight.com/en/articles/5-benefits-of-gamification-in-learning/)

* Makes learning fun

Having fun while learning engages the participant more.

* Gives the learners an opportunity to see real-world applications.

This is great for cementing skills.

*	The participant gets real time feedback.

Participant can reflect on mistakes and improve on them.

### Known Knowns, Known Unknowns, Unknown Knowns, and Unknown Unknowns

[Medium](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/known-knowns-unknown-knowns-and-unknown-unknowns-b35013fb350d)

* Known knowns are things that we **are** aware of and also understand.

"You know everything there is to know about how to create the paper airplane since a child. Now you just have to execute, and the problem is solved."

* Known unknowns are things that we **are** aware of but we do not understand.

"If you want to build a product with cloud native architecture, an expert is helpful to shift through the unknowns and create clarity."

* Unknown knowns are things that we are **not** aware of but we do understand them.

"Unknown knowns are those moments when you say, I feel like this is the right thing to do. This is a result of years of experience."

* Unknown unknowns are things that we are **not** aware of **and** we also do not understand.

These are the things that we didn't know we didn't know.

## Digital Twins

### What are Digital Twins?

[Forbes: Digital Twins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/03/06/what-is-digital-twin-technology-and-why-is-it-so-important/#1cd612f52e2a)

Digital Twins are a virtual implementation of a process, product or service. They are used by pairing the virtual world with the physical world together which allows for data analysis that can simulate what would happen in a real-life situation, prevent problems and prevent downtime.

### How does a Digital Twin work?

[HappiestMinds](https://www.happiestminds.com/insights/digital-twins/)

A digital twin is a bridge between the physical and virtual world. Using sensors physical, manufacturing and operational data can be collected. This information is integrated into a virtual model. This model can then be used for data analysis which helps optimize the best outcome in the physical world. The digital twin acts as a live model of the physical equipment.

### What benefits do Digital Twins bring?

[Slcontrols](https://slcontrols.com/what-is-digital-twin-technology-and-how-can-it-benefit-manufacturing/)

* Improved Productivity
*	Faster production times
*	Lower maintenance costs
*	Reduced risk in various areas
*	Improved product/training quality

Sara De Freitas was responsible for setting up the Serious Games Institute. The first institute of its kind. She writes many articles in the areas of game-based learning.

[Paper: Serious Games: A New Paradigm for Education?](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262545606_Serious_Games_A_New_Paradigm_for_Education)

Concludes:
* "Serious games are a new and emerging sector of the games
industry, but they are here to stay and could solve many of our key problems and
challenges with engaging learners as well as supporting social learning long into the
twenty-ﬁrst century."
